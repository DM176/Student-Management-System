# Student-Management-System
Managing student information manually becomes very hectic for both students as well as university management. Therefore, we made an online web application on which students can manage their tasks by sitting at home rather than visiting university and waiting in lines. Students can view their attendance, marks,  print their transcript and print their fee challan etc. Moreover, they can also
choose the courses they want to register. On the other hand, it will make life of academic officers easy too, as they also donâ€™t have to maintain the records manually, they can simply manage things such as registration of courses, keep record of attendance, getting student and course information by just one click.

In this project we will be maintained records of university students which will include their personal information, registered courses, transcripts, attendance, fee information, credit hours completed, credit hours attempted etc.
We developed it using java spring boot at backend and react at front end.
